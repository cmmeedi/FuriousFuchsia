A website that I redesigned using bootstrap

This website was designed using SitePad in which I have began redesigning it using bootstrap.  

The site features Forms, ::before and ::after, custom colors overtop the bootstrap classes using by ending the property with !important
to override the predefined bootstrap

Minor transitions to add visual effects on hover

This site has node.js implemented and will be connected to a server to store specific data of each user
